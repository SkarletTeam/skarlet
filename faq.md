### **1. What exactly does an MSP do?**
**Answer:**  
An MSP (Managed Service Provider) offers proactive IT support and management of your technology infrastructure, including servers, networks, security, and more. We monitor, maintain, and optimize your systems to ensure everything runs smoothly while preventing issues before they cause major disruptions. Additionally, we provide services like data backup, cybersecurity, compliance assistance, and help desk support.

### **2. How is an MSP different from a traditional break-fix IT service?**
**Answer:**  
Traditional break-fix IT services are reactive, meaning they only respond when something breaks or goes wrong. An MSP, on the other hand, is proactive. We continuously monitor and manage your IT environment to prevent problems from occurring in the first place. This reduces downtime, improves performance, and saves money on emergency repairs.

### **3. What size businesses benefit from MSP services?**
**Answer:**  
MSP services benefit businesses of all sizes, from small businesses with limited IT resources to larger companies with more complex needs. Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) often find MSP services particularly valuable because they can access enterprise-level support without the cost of an internal IT department.
