    <strong>How is an MSP different from a traditional break-fix IT service?</strong>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <blockquote class="blockquote mb-0">
      <p>Answer:</p>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer">Traditional break-fix IT services are reactive, meaning they only respond when something breaks or goes wrong. An MSP, on the other hand, is proactive. We continuously monitor and manage your IT environment to prevent problems from occurring in the first place. This reduces downtime, improves performance, and saves money on emergency repairs.</footer>
