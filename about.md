<h2 id="-about-skarlet-corp-your-trusted-it-partner-"><strong>About Skarlet Corp: Your Trusted IT Partner</strong></h2>
<p>Skarlet Corp was founded in 2024 with a simple but powerful mission: to provide businesses in rural Florida with reliable, affordable, and cutting-edge IT and cybersecurity services. Based in Old Town, Florida, Skarlet Corp proudly serves Dixie County and the surrounding areas, offering personalized solutions that meet the unique needs of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). We specialize in providing managed IT services, data backup solutions, and network security, with a focus on helping businesses thrive in today’s increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>At the core of Skarlet Corp is a deep understanding of the challenges faced by businesses in rural communities.

That’s where we come in—Skarlet Corp is dedicated to bridging the gap by delivering enterprise-grade technology solutions that are both affordable and scalable.</p>
<h3 id="-our-founder-s-vision-"><strong>Our Founder’s Vision</strong></h3>

Her career has spanned multiple industries, giving her the knowledge and insight to address the unique IT challenges faced by small businesses in today’s ever-changing technological landscape.</p>
<p>After spending years working for larger companies and witnessing the unique struggles of smaller businesses, J. Milford decided to create Skarlet Corp to provide personalized IT services to the local community.
