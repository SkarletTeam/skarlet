                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Our founding</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Skarlet Corp was founded in 2024 with a simple but powerful mission: to provide businesses in rural Florida with reliable, affordable, and cutting-edge IT and cybersecurity services. Based in Old Town, Florida, Skarlet Corp proudly serves Dixie County and the surrounding areas, offering personalized solutions that meet the unique needs of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). We specialize in providing managed IT services, data backup solutions, and network security, with a focus on helping businesses thrive in today’s increasingly digital world.
				
				At the core of Skarlet Corp is a deep understanding of the challenges faced by businesses in rural communities. We know that small businesses need to operate with the same level of security and efficiency as their larger counterparts but often lack the resources to invest in complex IT infrastructure. That’s where we come in—Skarlet Corp is dedicated to bridging the gap by delivering enterprise-grade technology solutions that are both affordable and scalable.</p>
